\section{Introduction}
"We also hope it might change your mind about what journalism could look like. We believe journalism doesnâ€™t always have to be a one-way conversation in which we present words for you to read. We also want to give you the tools to hold institutions in your life accountable for their choices." (\cite{angwinMakingPrivacyPersonal2020}) -> use this as explanation/motivation

Structure
\begin{itemize}
    \item humans have always communicated
    \item over the centuries, communication grew. From small, tight-knit communities, to larger communities, to one-sided mass-media communication, to globe-spanning social networks, allowing everyone with internet access to communicate with each other in real-time
    \item This opened communication empowered people to look up information for themselves, rather than having to rely on a single expert in their community. However, the internet is riddled with information with bad quality. This can lead to scepticism towards scientifically proven concepts and spread misinformation (\cite{krimskyRiskCommunicationInternet2007}).
    \item This, combined with the filter bubble-effect which enforces the opinion a user already has (\cite{pariser2011filter}), can lead to social problems. Discussions can become less diverse and everyone thinks they are right.
\end{itemize}

The goal of this thesis is two-fold: is it possible to automatically collect all German tweets to a specific topic and store them in a way that they can be analyzed? And can this data be processed and visualized in a way that allows laymen to gather information from this data?
