"We also hope it might change your mind about what journalism could look like. We believe journalism doesnâ€™t always have to be a one-way conversation in which we present words for you to read. We also want to give you the tools to hold institutions in your life accountable for their choices." (\cite{angwinMakingPrivacyPersonal2020})
