\section{Method reflection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Streaming API was the better option on the free tier. But this solution is not flexible enough to see how different topics get discussed on Twitter: the data collection ran over 2 months, and this might not be feasible.
    \item Accessibility Issues: too much reliance on colors alone. It would have been better to also include texture patterns. Both color and patterns are qualitative nominal variables, so they can encode the same information (\cite[1860]{borner2019}).
\end{itemize}
