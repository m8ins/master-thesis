\subsection{Twitter as microblogging platform}
The microblogging platform \emph{Twitter} allows users to post messages that are up to 280 characters long, so-called \emph{Tweets}. Users can follow other users; each user's timeline is then populated by tweets of people they follow (\cite{thimmTwitterAlsWahlkampfmedium2012}). Accounts can also be verified. This \say{lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic} (\cite{twitterinc.VerifiedAccounts}). 

Seeing that Twitter users share their opinions on many topics openly, the platform offers a good data source for researchers to assess the public's opinion (\cite{pak2010twitter}, \cite{pfaffenberger2016twitter}, \cite{broniatowski2014twitter}). Twitter also has a very diverse audience: Politicians and journalists are using the platform the same way as celebrities or regular users (\cite{pak2010twitter}), which lets researchers collect data from different social groups and groups with diverse interests. As opposed to other social networks, like Facebook, users can view tweets by all users instead of only by those users who are in their network (\cite{parkDoesTwitterMotivate2013}).

Twitter is also a medium that is widely used by the 'ordinary public', which means that people without celebrity status can use it as a platform to find an audience. A 2011 study conducted in South Korea shows that the majority of the most popular 1\% of tweets were sent by ordinary people instead of celebrities (\cite{chang2011structure}, as cited in \cite{parkDoesTwitterMotivate2013}). Furthermore, Twitter is a suitable survey tool. Prevalent problems of classical surveys---such as low sample size or selection bias---are no issue when collecting data on Twitter automatically (\cite{takabeTwitterSurveyTool2016}). 

Because of this openness, some scholars say that Twitter should be documented and archived as a historical record (\cite{risse2014documenting}). Twitter documents today's society in great detail---and, more importantly, individuals document their own experiences. This is a stark contrast to (historic) documentation in the past, where no direct documentation happened, but rather compiled reports of sorts. \citeauthor{risse2014documenting} argue that not only the text of a tweet is important, but also the context, like who sent the tweet and at what time. They also argue that further natural language processing is needed to search an archive for specific topics. This necessary natural language processing is no easy task on Twitter. Due to the 140-character-limit (which was doubled to 280 in recent years), many vernaculars and abbreviations are used, which can be difficult for natural language processors to process. Nevertheless, the authors claim that \say{Twitter can be seen as a comprehensive documentation of society} \parencite[9]{risse2014documenting}, and say that this documentation can be of immense historical value for future generations.

\subsection{Twitter as news source}  % Maybe "Twitter and crowd journalism" or something?
When Osama bin Laden was killed, the information was spread via Twitter before it hit major news outlets (\cite{hu2012breaking}). 
Even though the killing had not yet been confirmed at that time, a certainty analysis of the tweets sent between the first rumors and the official confirmation showed that many Twitter users were convinced that the rumors were true. This makes the bin Laden killing one of the earliest cases of Twitter being faster than traditional media, but equally accepted as a trustworthy source (\cite[2751]{hu2012breaking}). This shows that Twitter can be seen as a news source people trust.

A study examining the social media-usage around the protests of the 2010 G20 summit in Toronto shows that Twitter is a suitable platform for crowd-sourced journalism (\cite{poell2012twitter}). Crowd-sourced journalism, or alternative journalism, positions itself as the opposite of mainstream journalism. While mainstream coverage of protests often focuses on the events themselves, rather than the underlying issues people are protesting against, crowd journalism has the chance to shine a light on why people are protesting (\cite[698]{poell2012twitter}). The study analyzed the usage of three different social media platforms during the protests: Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr. Of the three platforms the researchers examined, Twitter was used by more people, and the retweeting-feature gave more silent users the possibility to weigh-in without having to create their content (cf. \cite[709]{poell2012twitter}). The authors concluded that the content published on social media-platforms was focused on sensationalist messages. This means that instead of focusing on the meaning of the protests, as intended in crowd-sourced journalism, the focus lay again on sensationalist pictures.

\subsection{Filter Bubble in social networks}
While social networks can connect people all over the world, scientists believe that their recommender algorithms are designed in a way that amplifies users' own opinions instead of connecting users with opposing views to generate healthy discussions (\cite{pariser2011filter}). This leads to worries about online discussions becoming less diverse. Rather than being exposed to a plethora of viewpoints and arguments, social media platforms and search engines decrease information diversity to improve engagement on their websites (\cite{bozdagBreakingFilterBubble2015}). One study found out that especially in political issues Twitter users tend to communicate mainly with users who share their political views (\cite{barberaTweetingLeftRight2015}).

%TODO: Noch ein bisschen mehr über die Filterbubble schreiben

How big the effect of the filter bubble is, remains unclear (\cite{brunsEchoChamberWhat2017}). A study examining the Australian twitter-sphere has found that while there are some clusters of Twitter users, \say{those connections have not been made to the exclusion of all others} (\cite[9]{brunsEchoChamberWhat2017}). This means that while there are distinct clusters, users from these clusters still have connections to people \emph{outside} their cluster: from a network-centric view, this indicates that filter bubbles don't exist. However, this study fails to incorporate Twitter's default news feed which shows algorithmically picked posts first rather than a chronological timeline of all activity in a network.

One survey conducted in the UK showed that politically interested users try to avoid echo chambers (\cite{duboisEchoChamberOverstated2018}). The participants report that they TODO: what do they report??


The fact that social networks influence people's opinions can become problematic (\cite{altafiniDynamicsOpinionForming2012}): people can adapt their opinion to match these of opinion leaders and believe that they are part of a majority, rather than a loud minority (\cite{moscoviciSilentMajoritiesLoud1991}), especially combined with the echo chamber effect. %TODO: Echo chamber näher erklären

%It appears as if Twitter is, on the one hand, a grassroots medium, allowing the broader public to engage in discussion and form an opinion

\subsection{Breaking the bubble using big data}
One way to break the bubble is to get a bird's eye view of the network. For this, the Twitter API can be used to automatically collect all public tweets that match certain criteria (\cite{twitterinc.TwitterAPIs}). The API allows easy access to tweets and provides functionality to filter tweets by keywords, hashtags, language, or geographic regions (\cite{bello2017detecting}). This allows scientists and coders to get a nearly full overview, unbiased by recommendation algorithms or personal preferences.

This method of data collection is not without its flaws, though. Over the last years, Twitter implemented a premium model for its API; due to the high costs for the premium access, scholarly research on Twitter has been limited (\cite{brunsTwitterDataWhat2014}). One example is that the free API plan only gives access to 1\% of the total current volume on Twitter. If 100,000 tweets are sent per minute over all of Twitter, the API would only give access to at most 1,000 tweets matching the query. Using the streaming API gives access to all tweets matching the given criteria in a given moment; however, access to Twitter's archives is impossible using this stream. This makes it necessary for researchers to use their own data base and collect data over a prolonged period of time.

A data collection such as this one is commonly called \emph{Big Data} (\cite{crawfordCriticalQuestionsBig2012}). This term used to refer to data sets that were so big that you needed a supercomputer to use them; \citeauthor{crawfordCriticalQuestionsBig2012} noticed, however, that the name nowadays carries technological, analytical, and mythological components. Big Data does not only mean bigger data sets, but also carries a \say{widespread belief that large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge} (\cite[3]{crawfordCriticalQuestionsBig2012}) accurately and objectively.

Seeing that this automated collection generates a huge data set, it is nearly impossible to analyze and categorize the collected data manually. As the last few years brought big advances in natural language analysis, this is not a problem anymore. Automated natural language analysis can be used to understand and explain social behavior in text-based social networks. \citeauthor{bahk2016publicly} developed a prototype for a dashboard that helps to monitor the population's sentiment toward vaccinations. The so-called 'anti-vaxxers' pose a real threat to the wider population because vaccines only work effectively if a majority is vaccinated. Thus, it is interesting to know when and where negative sentiment towards vaccinations arises to formulate countermeasures, like targeted information campaigns. The authors searched Twitter for vaccine-related messages and coded them using sentiment analysis. The data is presented on a dashboard, which shows the negative sentiment per country, along with further filters. According to the authors, \say{[the dashboard] can be used to detect early signals in shifting conversations about vaccination} (\cite[343]{bahk2016publicly}).

Another study found that Twitter is a useful source for measuring climate change awareness (\cite{codyClimateChangeSentiment2015}). The authors of this study developed a so-called \say{Hedonometer} that they use to compute a happiness-score for tweets. First, they used Amazon's \emph{Mechanical Turk} service to let people rate words in a corpus on a scale from 1--least happy to 9--most happy. Then they used this annotated corpus to compute the overall happiness of a tweet. With this set of happiness-scores for tweets, \citeauthor{codyClimateChangeSentiment2015} mapped out the average happiness of tweets that contained the word \emph{climate} compared to the average happiness of all collected tweets. This gave the authors an unfiltered insight into how the general public perceives climate change and the surrounding discussions.

\subsection{Why is Datavis important?}

%TODO: Schöneren Subsection-Titel finden

In the last couple of years we generated more data than in the combined history of humankind (\cite{helbing2019will})---and with the Internet of Things on the rise, experts assume that the amount of data will double every 12 hours.

The more data we collect, %and the more ubiquitious data-driven decision-emaking becomes (\cite{brynjolfsson_strength_2011}),
the more important it becomes to understand big data (\cite{bornerDataVisualizationLiteracy2019}). As human perception is fine-tuned to recognize underlying patterns, trends, and outliers, \emph{Data Visualization} is one of the most common tools to explore and communicate big data sets (\cite{heerTourVisualizationZoo2010}). It helps to make sense of big data in a more intuitive way than reading database tables or big charts (\cite{donalekImmersiveCollaborativeData2014}).

Even though data visualizations are known to help people to understand big data sets, studies have shown that laymen do not have the required knowledge to accurately read complex visualizations (\cite{bornerInvestigatingAspectsData2016}). %This means that data visualizations have to be constructed carefully and assume almost no previous knowledge when it comes to explanatory texts.
Even though our visual system is trained to spot trends and outliers, data visualization is not inherently self-explanatory. Our ability to extract information from visualizations answering questions based on data sets is called \emph{Data Literacy} (\cite{boyPrincipledWayAssessing2014}). Improving this literacy allows people to not only improve their communication and collaboration on data sets, but also their understanding of the world as shown by big data (\cite{bornerDataVisualizationLiteracy2019}). 
%A good data visualization does not provide definite answers in itself; rather, it should support the users in the search for results (\cite{light2001portable}).
