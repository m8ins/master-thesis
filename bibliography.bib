For instance, a personalised news website could give more prominence to conservative or liberal media items, based on the (assumed) political interests of the user. As a result, users may encounter only a limited range of political ideas. We synthesise empirical research on the extent and effects of self-selected personalisation, where people actively choose which content they receive, and pre-selected personalisation, where algorithms personalise content for users without any deliberate user choice. We conclude that at present there is little empirical evidence that warrants any worries about filter bubbles.},

	abstract = {Online publishing, social networks, and web search have dramatically lowered the costs of producing, distributing, and discovering news articles. Some scholars argue that such technological changes increase exposure to diverse perspectives, while others worry that they increase ideological segregation. We address the issue by examining webbrowsing histories for 50,000 {US}-located users who regularly read online news. We find that social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals. However, somewhat counterintuitively, these same channels also are associated with an increase in an individual’s exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum. Finally, the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets, tempering the consequences—both positive and negative—of recent technological changes. We thus uncover evidence for both sides of the debate, while also finding that the magnitude of the effects is relatively modest.},

While this criticism has focused on the ‘filter bubbles’ created by the site’s personalisation algorithms, our research indicates that users’ own actions also play a key role in how the site operates as a forum for debate. Our findings show that the strategies people use to navigate the complex social space contribute to the polarising of debate, as they seek to avoid conflict with the diverse members of their network.},

This study therefore explores citizen support for populist and establishment candidates across the ideological spectrum in the {US} to specifically examine if using social media was related to an increased likelihood of supporting populist presidential political candidates, including Trump. Differing forms of active, passive, and uncivil social media were taken into account and the findings suggest active social media use for politics was actually related to less support for Republican populists, such as Trump, but that forms of both passive or uncivil social media use were linked to an increase in the likelihood of support to a level roughly equivalent to that of the traditional television viewing. These patterns are almost the inverse of support for Democratic populists, in this case namely Sanders.},

However, critics have argued that algorithms used by search engines, social networking platforms and other large online intermediaries actually decrease information diversity by forming so-called ‘‘ﬁlter bubbles’’. This may form a serious threat to our democracies. In response to this threat others have developed algorithms and digital tools to combat ﬁlter bubbles. This paper ﬁrst provides examples of different software designs that try to break ﬁlter bubbles. Secondly, we show how norms required by two democracy models dominate the tools that are developed to ﬁght the ﬁlter bubbles, while norms of other models are completely missing in the tools. The paper in conclusion argues that democracy itself is a contested concept and points to a variety of norms. Designers of diversity enhancing tools must thus be exposed to diverse conceptions of democracy.},

This could lead to partisan echo chambers among those who are politically interested and could contribute to a growing gap in knowledge between those who are politically interested and those who are not. However, the high-choice environment also allows individuals, including those who are politically interested, to consume a wide variety of media, which could lead them to more diverse content and perspectives. This study examines the relationship between political interest as well as media diversity and being caught in an echo chamber (measured by five different variables). Using a nationally representative survey of adult internet users in the United Kingdom (N = 2000), we find that those who are interested in politics and those with diverse media diets tend to avoid echo chambers. This work challenges the impact of echo chambers and tempers fears of partisan segregation since only a small segment of the population are likely to find themselves in an echo chamber. We argue that single media studies and studies which use narrow definitions and measurements of being in an echo chamber are flawed because they do not test the theory in the realistic context of a multiple media environment.},

Discussion of the Newtown shootings in 2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation before transforming into a polarized exchange. With respect to both political and nonpolitical issues, liberals were more likely than conservatives to engage in cross-ideological dissemination; this is an important asymmetry with respect to the structure of communication that is consistent with psychological theory and research bearing on ideological differences in epistemic, existential, and relational motivation. Overall, we conclude that previous work may have overestimated the degree of ideological segregation in social-media usage.},

            Die Covid-19-Pandemie ist eine Gesundheits- und eine Wirtschaftskrise. Die politischen Reaktionen auf beide sind aufgrund der durch fehlende Daten verursachten Unsicherheit nicht optimal. Der Mangel an Daten schränkt den Einsatz von Künstlicher Intelligenz ({KI}) und die Genauigkeit epidemiologischer Modelle ein. Infolgedessen ist die Künstliche Intelligenz noch nicht in der Lage, bei der Vorhersage, dem Tracking und der Diagnose von Covid-19-Infektionen wirklich zu helfen. Der Mangel an Trainingsdaten für die {KI} schränkt die Verwendung von datenschutzsensitiven Tracing-Apps weiter ein. Wim Naudé kommt zu dem Schluss, dass das Sammeln ausreichender und geeigneter, unverzerrter Daten, gewonnen auch aus Apps und groß angelegten diagnostischen Tests, eine Voraussetzung für die Verbesserung der Strategien zur Bewältigung der Zwillingskrisen ist. Angesichts der exorbitanten wirtschaftlichen Kosten der bisher angewandten ziemlich groben Eindämmungsmaßnahmen werden „intelligente“ Eindämmungsstrategien, die auf einer besseren Datenanalyse beruhen, die Wiederaufnahme der wirtschaftlichen Tätigkeit ermöglichen und verhindern, dass es zu weiteren Infektionswellen kommt. Den Datenschutz zu garantieren und öffentliches Vertrauen zu den Datenanalyse- und {KI}-Systemen intelligenter Eindämmungsstrategien aufzubauen, ist jetzt noch dringlicher als je zuvor.},

It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition, and thus an essential component of the scientific path from data into knowledge and understanding. Visualization is also essential in the data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and in helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multidimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space. Immersion provides benefits beyond the traditional “desktop” visualization tools: it leads to a demonstrably better perception of a datascape geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.},

Using instrumental variables methods, we find evidence that the effect of {DDD} on the productivity do not appear to be due to reverse causality. Our results provide some of the first large scale data on the direct connection between data-driven decision making and firm performance.},

	abstract = {Background: Twitter has been recognized as an important source of organic sentiment and opinion. This study aimed to (1) characterize the content of tweets authored by the United States cancer patients; and (2) use patient tweets to compute the average happiness of cancer patients for each cancer diagnosis.
Methods: A large sample of English tweets from March 2014 through December 2014 was obtained from Twitter. Using regular expression software pattern matching, the tweets were ﬁltered by cancer diagnosis. For each cancer-speciﬁc tweetset, individual patients were extracted, and the content of the tweet was categorized. The patients’ Twitter identiﬁcation numbers were used to gather all tweets for each patient, and happiness values for patient tweets were calculated using a quantitative hedonometric analysis.
Results: The most frequently tweeted cancers were breast (n ¼ 15,421, 11\% of total cancer tweets), lung (n ¼ 2928, 2.0\%), prostate (n ¼ 1036, 0.7\%), and colorectal (n ¼ 773, 0.5\%). Patient tweets pertained to the treatment course (n ¼ 73, 26\%), diagnosis (n ¼ 65, 23\%), and then surgery and/or biopsy (n ¼ 42, 15\%). Computed happiness values for each cancer diagnosis revealed higher average happiness values for thyroid (h\_avg ¼ 6.1625), breast (h\_avg ¼ 6.1485), and lymphoma (h\_avg ¼ 6.0977) cancers and lower average happiness values for pancreatic (h\_avg ¼ 5.8766), lung (h\_avg ¼ 5.8733), and kidney (h\_avg ¼ 5.8464) cancers.
Conclusions: The study conﬁrms that patients are expressing themselves openly on social media about their illness and that unique cancer diagnoses are correlated with varying degrees of happiness. Twitter can be employed as a tool to identify patient needs and as a means to gauge the cancer patient experience.},

Recent events such as the Gezi Park protests, the Occupy Wall Street, or the antigovernment protests in Iran demonstrate how effective social media can be in shaping an individual’s political attitudes and actions. Traditional public opinion research does not acknowledge this emerging data source to its fullest extent. In this study, ﬁndings from the “Identifying Policy Opinion Shapers and Trends in Turkey” project, which has been collecting and exploring Twitter data to deﬁne how the online political debates are shaped in Turkey, are presented. Having identiﬁed over ten million active Turkish Twitter users and produced a social network graph of these users, this study identiﬁes public opinion leadership in the Turkish online discussion space. The ﬁndings suggest that who these opinion leaders are may not follow the conventional expectations, but these leaders employ various tactics in managing their online presence and disseminating their ideas. This research endeavor as well as the ﬁndings suggests that engaging in cross-disciplinary research with scholars from different backgrounds can advance Turkish studies, in terms of both content and methodology. Most importantly, such interdisciplinary research can render signiﬁcant leverage toward making Turkey more globally salient for scholarly debates.},

	abstract = {In the information age, a person’s ability to read and make data visualizations is nearly as important as being able to read and write text. This article reports the results of a multi-phase study conducted in informal learning environments in three {US} science museums. The goal of the study was to determine the familiarity of youth and adult museum visitors with different visualization types. To address this, a total of 273 visitors were shown 5 out of 20 different visualizations that included two charts, five maps, eight graphs, and five network layouts. They were asked to judge the familiarity of the visualization, provide information on how to read it, and provide a name and identify typical locations where they would encounter the data display and possible data sources that might be visualized in this way. The results show that while most participants have a strong interest in science, math, and art, many have a hard time naming and interpreting visualizations. Participants in this study commonly encounter visualizations in school, in books, at work, on the Internet, and in the news. Overall, they were more familiar with basic charts, maps, and graphs, but very few are familiar with network layouts and most have no ability in reading network visualizations. When asked how they would interpret the visualizations, most participants pointed to superficial features such as color, lines, or text as important to developing understanding. Overall, we found that participants were interested in the visualizations we presented to them, but had significant limitations in identifying and understanding them. The results substantiate intuitions shared by many regarding the rather low level of data visualization literacy of general audiences. We hope they will help catalyze novel research on the development of easy-to-use yet effective visualizations with standardized names and guaranteed properties that can be readily used by those interested to understand and solve real-world problems. The results also have implications for how information visualizations are taught and used in formal and informal education, the media, or in different professions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Social media platforms are important channels through which health education about the utility and safety of vaccination is conducted.
Objective: To investigate if tweets with different sentiments toward vaccination and different contents attract different levels of Twitter users’ engagement (retweets).
Methods: A stratified random sample (N = 1425) of 142,891 \#vaccine tweets (February 4, 2010, to November 10, 2016) was manually coded. All 201 tweets with 100 or more retweets from 194,259 \#vaccineswork tweets (January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015) were manually coded. Regression models were applied to identify factors associated with retweet frequency.
Results: Among \#vaccine tweets, provaccine tweets (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.5836, 95\% confidence interval = 1.2130-2.0713, p {\textless} 0.001) and antivaccine tweets (adjusted prevalence ratio = 4.1280, 95\% confidence interval = 3.1183-5.4901, p {\textless} 0.001) had more retweets than neutral tweets. No significant differences occurred in retweet frequency for content categories among antivaccine tweets. Among 411 links in provaccine tweets, Twitter (53; 12.9\%), content curator Trap.it (14; 3.4\%), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (8; 1.9\%) ranked as the top 3 domains. Among 325 links in antivaccine tweets, social media links were common: Twitter (44; 14.9\%), {YouTube} (25; 8.4\%), and Facebook (10; 3.4\%). Among highly retweeted \#vaccineswork tweets, the most common theme was childhood vaccinations (40\%; 81/201); 21\% mentioned global vaccination improvement/ efforts (42/201); 29\% mentioned vaccines can prevent outbreaks and deaths (58/201).
Conclusion: Engaging social media key opinion leaders to facilitate health education about vaccination in their tweets may allow reaching a wider audience online.},

	abstract = {Irony is a pervasive aspect of many online texts, one made all the more difﬁcult by the absence of face-to-face contact and vocal intonation. As our media increasingly become more social, the problem of irony detection will become even more pressing. We describe here a set of textual features for recognizing irony at a linguistic level, especially in short texts created via social media such as Twitter postings or ‘‘tweets’’. Our experiments concern four freely available data sets that were retrieved from Twitter using content words (e.g. ‘‘Toyota’’) and user-generated tags (e.g. ‘‘\#irony’’). We construct a new model of irony detection that is assessed along two dimensions: representativeness and relevance. Initial results are largely positive, and provide valuable insights into the ﬁgurative issues facing tasks such as sentiment analysis, assessment of online reputations, or decision making.},

It ﬁnds that Twitter opinion leaders have higher motivations of information seeking, mobilization, and public expression than nonleaders. It has also been found that mobilization and public-expression motivations mediate the association between perceived opinion leadership and Twitter use frequency. Most importantly, this study ﬁnds that Twitter opinion leadership makes a signiﬁcant contribution to individuals’ involvement in political processes, while Twitter use itself or media use motivation does not necessarily help individuals’ political engagement.},

	abstract = {Misinformation can have signiﬁcant societal consequences. For example, misinformation about climate change has confused the public and stalled support for mitigation policies. When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the inﬂuence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identiﬁcation of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and ﬁnd that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientiﬁc consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. This comprehensive deconstruction and refutation of the most common denialist claims about climate change is designed to act as a resource for communicators and educators who teach climate science and/or critical thinking.},

This paper introduces a data visualization literacy framework ({DVL}-{FW}) that was specifically developed to define, teach, and assess {DVL}. The holistic {DVL}-{FW} promotes both the reading and construction of data visualizations, a pairing analogous to that of both reading and writing in textual literacy and understanding and applying in mathematical literacy. Specifically, the {DVL}-{FW} defines a hierarchical typology of core concepts and details the process steps that are required to extract insights from data. Advancing the state of the art, the {DVL}-{FW} interlinks theoretical and procedural knowledge and showcases how both can be combined to design curricula and assessment measures for {DVL}. Earlier versions of the {DVL}-{FW} have been used to teach {DVL} to more than 8,500 residential and online students, and results from this effort have helped revise and validate the {DVL}-{FW} presented here.},

However, in describing the response of agricultural scientists to these demands, research has focused on the content of their scientific work, that is, their methods, empirical interests, and theories. This study, by contrast, explores how the debates on applied vs. fundamental/basic research in American agricultural science were closely linked to the question of how scientific knowledge could be made understood to laymen and practitioners.},

Early attempts to reduce decision biases with training met with little success, leading scientists and policy makers to focus on debiasing by using incentives and changes in the presentation and elicitation of decisions. We report the results of two longitudinal experiments that found medium to large effects of one-shot debiasing training interventions. Participants received a single training intervention, played a computer game or watched an instructional video, which addressed biases critical to intelligence analysis (in Experiment 1: bias blind spot, confirmation bias, and fundamental attribution error; in Experiment 2: anchoring, representativeness, and social projection). Both kinds of interventions produced medium to large debiasing effects immediately (games ≥ −31.94\% and videos ≥ −18.60\%) that persisted at least 2 months later (games ≥ −23.57\% and videos ≥ −19.20\%). Games that provided personalized feedback and practice produced larger effects than did videos. Debiasing effects were domain general: bias reduction occurred across problems in different contexts, and problem formats that were taught and not taught in the interventions. The results suggest that a single training intervention can improve decision making. We suggest its use alongside improved incentives, information presentation, and nudges to reduce costly errors associated with biased judgments and decisions.},
