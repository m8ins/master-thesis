	abstract = {After the news of Osama Bin Laden’s death leaked through Twitter, many people wondered if Twitter would fundamentally change the way we produce, spread, and consume news. In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of how the news broke and spread on Twitter. We conﬁrm the claim that Twitter broke the news ﬁrst, and ﬁnd evidence that Twitter had convinced a large number of its audience before mainstream media reported the news. We also discover that attention on Twitter was highly concentrated on a small number of “opinion leaders” and identify three groups of opinion leaders who played key roles in spreading the news: individuals afﬁliated with media played a large part in breaking the news, mass media brought the news to a wider audience and provided eager Twitter users with content on external sites, and celebrities helped to spread the news and stimulate conversation. Our ﬁndings suggest Twitter has great potential as a news medium.},

Irony, a creative use of language, has received very little attention from the computational linguistics research point of view. In this study we investigate the automatic detection of irony casting it as a classiﬁcation problem. We propose a model capable of detecting irony in the social network Twitter. In cross-domain classiﬁcation experiments our model based on lexical features outperforms a word-based baseline previously used in opinion mining and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our features are simple to implement making the approach easily replicable.},

Recent events such as the Gezi Park protests, the Occupy Wall Street, or the antigovernment protests in Iran demonstrate how effective social media can be in shaping an individual’s political attitudes and actions. Traditional public opinion research does not acknowledge this emerging data source to its fullest extent. In this study, ﬁndings from the “Identifying Policy Opinion Shapers and Trends in Turkey” project, which has been collecting and exploring Twitter data to deﬁne how the online political debates are shaped in Turkey, are presented. Having identiﬁed over ten million active Turkish Twitter users and produced a social network graph of these users, this study identiﬁes public opinion leadership in the Turkish online discussion space. The ﬁndings suggest that who these opinion leaders are may not follow the conventional expectations, but these leaders employ various tactics in managing their online presence and disseminating their ideas. This research endeavor as well as the ﬁndings suggests that engaging in cross-disciplinary research with scholars from different backgrounds can advance Turkish studies, in terms of both content and methodology. Most importantly, such interdisciplinary research can render signiﬁcant leverage toward making Turkey more globally salient for scholarly debates.},

	abstract = {In the information age, a person’s ability to read and make data visualizations is nearly as important as being able to read and write text. This article reports the results of a multi-phase study conducted in informal learning environments in three {US} science museums. The goal of the study was to determine the familiarity of youth and adult museum visitors with different visualization types. To address this, a total of 273 visitors were shown 5 out of 20 different visualizations that included two charts, five maps, eight graphs, and five network layouts. They were asked to judge the familiarity of the visualization, provide information on how to read it, and provide a name and identify typical locations where they would encounter the data display and possible data sources that might be visualized in this way. The results show that while most participants have a strong interest in science, math, and art, many have a hard time naming and interpreting visualizations. Participants in this study commonly encounter visualizations in school, in books, at work, on the Internet, and in the news. Overall, they were more familiar with basic charts, maps, and graphs, but very few are familiar with network layouts and most have no ability in reading network visualizations. When asked how they would interpret the visualizations, most participants pointed to superficial features such as color, lines, or text as important to developing understanding. Overall, we found that participants were interested in the visualizations we presented to them, but had significant limitations in identifying and understanding them. The results substantiate intuitions shared by many regarding the rather low level of data visualization literacy of general audiences. We hope they will help catalyze novel research on the development of easy-to-use yet effective visualizations with standardized names and guaranteed properties that can be readily used by those interested to understand and solve real-world problems. The results also have implications for how information visualizations are taught and used in formal and informal education, the media, or in different professions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Social media platforms are important channels through which health education about the utility and safety of vaccination is conducted.
Objective: To investigate if tweets with different sentiments toward vaccination and different contents attract different levels of Twitter users’ engagement (retweets).
Methods: A stratified random sample (N = 1425) of 142,891 \#vaccine tweets (February 4, 2010, to November 10, 2016) was manually coded. All 201 tweets with 100 or more retweets from 194,259 \#vaccineswork tweets (January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015) were manually coded. Regression models were applied to identify factors associated with retweet frequency.
Results: Among \#vaccine tweets, provaccine tweets (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.5836, 95\% confidence interval = 1.2130-2.0713, p {\textless} 0.001) and antivaccine tweets (adjusted prevalence ratio = 4.1280, 95\% confidence interval = 3.1183-5.4901, p {\textless} 0.001) had more retweets than neutral tweets. No significant differences occurred in retweet frequency for content categories among antivaccine tweets. Among 411 links in provaccine tweets, Twitter (53; 12.9\%), content curator Trap.it (14; 3.4\%), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (8; 1.9\%) ranked as the top 3 domains. Among 325 links in antivaccine tweets, social media links were common: Twitter (44; 14.9\%), {YouTube} (25; 8.4\%), and Facebook (10; 3.4\%). Among highly retweeted \#vaccineswork tweets, the most common theme was childhood vaccinations (40\%; 81/201); 21\% mentioned global vaccination improvement/ efforts (42/201); 29\% mentioned vaccines can prevent outbreaks and deaths (58/201).
Conclusion: Engaging social media key opinion leaders to facilitate health education about vaccination in their tweets may allow reaching a wider audience online.},

Our experiments concern four freely available data sets that were retrieved from Twitter using content words (e.g. ‘‘Toyota’’) and user-generated tags (e.g. ‘‘\#irony’’). We construct a new model of irony detection that is assessed along two dimensions: representativeness and relevance.

	abstract = {Misinformation can have signiﬁcant societal consequences. For example, misinformation about climate change has confused the public and stalled support for mitigation policies. When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the inﬂuence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identiﬁcation of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and ﬁnd that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientiﬁc consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. This comprehensive deconstruction and refutation of the most common denialist claims about climate change is designed to act as a resource for communicators and educators who teach climate science and/or critical thinking.},

However, while standard definitions and theoretical frameworks to teach and assess textual, mathematical, and visual literacy exist, current data visualization literacy ({DVL}) definitions and frameworks are not comprehensive enough to guide the design of {DVL} teaching and assessment. This paper introduces a data visualization literacy framework ({DVL}-{FW}) that was specifically developed to define, teach, and assess {DVL}. The holistic {DVL}-{FW} promotes both the reading and construction of data visualizations, a pairing analogous to that of both reading and writing in textual literacy and understanding and applying in mathematical literacy. Specifically, the {DVL}-{FW} defines a hierarchical typology of core concepts and details the process steps that are required to extract insights from data. Advancing the state of the art, the {DVL}-{FW} interlinks theoretical and procedural knowledge and showcases how both can be combined to design curricula and assessment measures for {DVL}. Earlier versions of the {DVL}-{FW} have been used to teach {DVL} to more than 8,500 residential and online students, and results from this effort have helped revise and validate the {DVL}-{FW} presented here.},

This study measured levels of news media literacy among 500 teenagers using a new scale measure based on Potter’s 2004 model of media literacy and adapted to news media specifically. The adapted model posits that news media literate individuals think deeply about media experiences, believe they are in control of media’s influence, and have high levels of basic knowledge about media content, industries, and effects. Based on measures developed to assess news media literacy, highly news literate teens were found to be more intrinsically motivated to consume news, more skeptical, and more knowledgeable about current events than their less news literate counterparts.},

Traditionally individuals gather feedback from their friends or relatives beforepurchasing an item, but today the trend is to identify the opinions of a variety ofindividuals around the globe using microbloggingdata. This paper discusses an approach where a publicised stream of tweets from the Twitter microblogging site are preprocessed and classified based on their emotional content as positive, negative and irrelevant; and analyses the performance of various classifying algorithms based on their precision and recall in such cases. Further, the paper exemplifies the applications of this research and its limitations.},

Previous historical studies of agricultural science in the period have not overlooked the increasing demands for applicability that agricultural scientists were faced with at the time. However, in describing the response of agricultural scientists to these demands, research has focused on the content of their scientific work, that is, their methods, empirical interests, and theories. This study, by contrast, explores how the debates on applied vs. fundamental/basic research in American agricultural science were closely linked to the question of how scientific knowledge could be made understood to laymen and practitioners.},

	abstract = {From failures of intelligence analysis to misguided beliefs about vaccinations, biased judgment and decision making contributes to problems in policy, business, medicine, law, education, and private life. Early attempts to reduce decision biases with training met with little success, leading scientists and policy makers to focus on debiasing by using incentives and changes in the presentation and elicitation of decisions. We report the results of two longitudinal experiments that found medium to large effects of one-shot debiasing training interventions. Participants received a single training intervention, played a computer game or watched an instructional video, which addressed biases critical to intelligence analysis (in Experiment 1: bias blind spot, confirmation bias, and fundamental attribution error; in Experiment 2: anchoring, representativeness, and social projection). Both kinds of interventions produced medium to large debiasing effects immediately (games ≥ −31.94\% and videos ≥ −18.60\%) that persisted at least 2 months later (games ≥ −23.57\% and videos ≥ −19.20\%). Games that provided personalized feedback and practice produced larger effects than did videos. Debiasing effects were domain general: bias reduction occurred across problems in different contexts, and problem formats that were taught and not taught in the interventions. The results suggest that a single training intervention can improve decision making. We suggest its use alongside improved incentives, information presentation, and nudges to reduce costly errors associated with biased judgments and decisions.},

The ﬁrst entry in our guide is made by a set of visual variables appropriate for representing areal uncertainty in algorithm mechanics. Such visualisations show users how data points are distributed in the classiﬁcation space and allow them to understand the “goodness-of-ﬁt” of their data to the algorithm. This is important for Visual Analytics applications, which combine information visualisation with information mining techniques in an interactive decision-making process. Model uncertainties stemming from widely spread data points need to be visualised so that the user can make adjustments and improve the analysis.},
